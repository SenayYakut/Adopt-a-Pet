# Adopt a Pet

Imagine you are looking to add a new furry friend to your family! On the pet adoption website, you browse through the categories of animals and select the one youâ€™re interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.

Every time you navigate to a different webpage, your browser is making a request to the web server. Thanks to routing, the server knows exactly which endpoint should handle the request and can return the correct HTML page to display.
